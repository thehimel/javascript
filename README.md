# js-basics

In this repository, I share my knowledge of JS.

I have learned JavaScript from the resources mentioned below. Thus, if there is any code that is similar to any of the sources, the credits goes to them. In some cases, I have added my own scripts, and in some cases I have kept few scripts similar as it will allow me to revise faster.
I love to write code in the most precise and shortest way, that's why I've compiled the scripts in the most concised manner.
