# js-basics

In this repository, I share my knowledge of JS.

I have learned JavaScript from the resources mentioned below. The codes are a mixture of my codes and the codes from the below resouces. In some cases I have kept few codes similar as it will allow me to revise faster. Thus, if there is any code that is similar to any of the sources, the credits goes to them.

I love to write code in the most precise and shortest way, that's why I've compiled the scripts in the most concised manner.
